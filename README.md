## Project description
To demonstrate the learning outcomes of my Django elective, 
I have made a social app where students can create groups and comment within them.
For that, I needed 3 models: User, Group, and Post.

The project includes user authentication (using signals), and custom middleware that checks if a user is authenticated.
